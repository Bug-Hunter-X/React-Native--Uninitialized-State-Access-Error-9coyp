This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This is common when using functional components and the `useState` hook.  If the component renders before the state has had a chance to update, you'll get an undefined value, leading to errors like `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...attribute...')`.

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData().then(setData);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.someProperty}</Text> {/* Error here if fetchData is slow */}
    </View>
  );
}
```
